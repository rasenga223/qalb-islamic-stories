## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to expand this library of authentic Islamic stories.

### üìå Contribution Guidelines

1. **Authenticity First**

   * Only include stories from **authentic sources** such as the Qur‚Äôan, Sahih hadith collections, and reliable Islamic history books (e.g., *Qasas al-Anbiya* by Ibn Kathir).
   * Always provide a `source` reference in the story entry.

2. **Format Consistency**

   * Follow the JSON structure exactly.
   * Ensure all fields are present: `id`, `title`, `languages`, `image`, `description`, `source`.

3. **Language Links**

   * Use public, direct URLs for the `languages` links (e.g., SoundCloud, YouTube, MP3 file links).
   * If a language version is unavailable, omit that key from the `languages` object.

4. **Images**

   * Use URLs to images hosted on public CDNs or trusted hosting platforms.
   * Avoid copyrighted or watermarked images unless permission is granted.
